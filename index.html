          <h2>Story</h2>
          <p>Even dandies have origins.</p>
          <h3>Chef. Chemist. Teacher. Business.</h3>
          <p>
            The story goes back. Two high-school classmates begin a business,
            they graduated and went their separate ways. They cross paths again
            years later to discuss an interest, and a passion.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the fall of 2013, the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission made
            sweeping changes to the brewing industry in Alberta, allowing small
            craft breweries to exist. It came at a perfect time. For years Ben
            Leon, a teacher, and Dylan Nosal, a chef, had been growing their
            home-brew experience, not only in size but also in knowledge. Over
            the course of a few years of practice, learning, and many batches,
            they began brewing exceptional beers on a home-built 1BBL brewhouse.
          </p>
          <p>
            While honing skills, the two were developing a keen taste for the
            growing selection of Craft beer flooding into Alberta. Much of their
            guidance came from Matt Gaetz, a veteran of the liquor business in
            Alberta, and a close friend. Between the three of them, the topic of
            starting something amazing often came up over beers and brewing.
            They knew they wanted it, they just weren't sure it was possible
            under old laws. Changes in law meant it was possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Discussion after discussion, batch after batch, ideas developed into
            plans. What it always boiled down to was that the brewery would have
            to be exciting, forward thinking, and outside the traditional
            thought box for breweries in the province. Exciting beer styles,
            quality ingredients, and attention to every detail of production. <span id="dots">...</span>

            Cue the return of Derek Waghray, a high-school friend studying
            chemistry on the West coast. On his return to Calgary, and with a
            new-found interest in brewing and craft beer, he got in touch with
            an old high school friend. A home brew batch later, and a discussion
            of wild dreams, he was added to the group. He was a much needed
            addition bringing expertise in laboratory process and a deep
            understanding of the science behind the beer.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the laws were officially changed in December 2013, the four
            Dandies moved quickly to hammer out the final details for The Dandy
            Brewing Company.
          </p>
          <p>
            In January 2014 the Dandy Brewing Company was incorporated. April
            2014 the lease was signed. June 2014 the brewhouse was built. August
            2014 the brewing began. September 2014 the beer hit the shelves.
            April 2015 the first draught accounts started pouring. November 2015
            the Tap Room opened. January 2016 a three-fold expansion of capacity
            was completed.
          </p>
          <p>
            April 2018 saw the opening of the The Dandy Brewing Company and
            Tasting Room, a new production facility and full service tasting
            room located in the heart of Ramsay, Calgary. Fine Dining drinking
            food. Dandy beers. Cocktails. wine. The full Dandy experience.
